zombie mechanics:
basically infectious barbarians that only gets spawned via events
zombies start out weak but gets stronger and numerous by midgame, but naturally decays (unless special zombies)
special zombies are either added via events or via chance, by infecting certain units
infection status that can't be cured until mid-to-lategame that slowly saps life (5hp per turn?)
units that die with infection status fires an event that adds a zombie on barbarians
